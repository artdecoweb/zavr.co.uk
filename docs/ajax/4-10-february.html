{"title":"4-10 February 2019","content":"<h2>February</h2>\n\nThe last month of winter!\n\n<p class=\"SectionBreak\">\n  <a href=\"#top\" title=\"Back To Top\">\n    <img src=\"section-breaks/0.svg\" alt=\"Back To Top\">\n  </a>\n</p>\n\n<h2>10 Sunday</h2>\n\nToday I focused on closing 2 issues in the JSX: trimming of new lines as React does, and allowing for JSX attributes. The job was fairly easy because the tests already existed, so that it was programming for results, i.e., to have an idea and quickly adjust the program to make it possible. I spent some amount of time on updating the <span class=\"tm\">rexml</span> package to be able to extract XML attributes, and then integrated it in <em>JSX</em>, however I realised I could do the parsing without it by a generic algorithm, so although I released the change to <span class=\"tm\">rexml</span>, it was not used in the end. Finally, I was happy to close the 2 issues created on GitHub, and I have to complete the other two within a week so that the package receives the positive ranking by NPM search which takes into account how many issues were closes within a certain period of time. Finally, I made the quick change to <em>Splendid</em> to be able to reverse the order of how files in a directory are put together, to facilitate the blog structure.\n\n<p>\n  Overall, I had a good week with getting back to blogging about work and tracking the process. Although I spent a bit of time on writing about what I've done in the previous day, it helps me to remember things I came across and note down the future <strong>todo</strong> points. The main job was to allow to bundle frontend packages with <em>Depack</em> and I discovered that it was more complicated than I though before because previously I didn't account for the fact that node_modules\n  packages could import other packages as well. I transferred the existing code into smaller packages, documented and tested them which is the correct strategy for utilising scopes and organisations.\n</p>\n\n<img style=\"padding-top:1rem; display: block;\" src=\"img/2019/2-feb/2-10-work.png\">\n\n<p class=\"SectionBreak\">\n  <a href=\"#top\" title=\"Back To Top\">\n    <img src=\"section-breaks/1.svg\" alt=\"Back To Top\">\n  </a>\n</p>\n\n<h2>9 Saturday</h2>\n\nToday I picked up on the stuff from yesterday where the bugs in <em>Frontend</em> and <em>Depack</em> were identified. The main question that required thinking was how to compile <span class=\"tm\">node_modules</span> in <em>Depack</em> that export JSX components. The strategy I though I would adopt was to not even build packages and publish their source code directly like its 2019, so that <em>Frontend</em> can serve them for development, and <em>Depack</em> can use them in compilation. However, the compilation step would require transpiling JSX syntax and putting new files in the temp directory, but also then overriding the import statements that import such packages to point them to the transpiled version of the code. The things become even more complicated when 3rd party packages also import JSX-based files. In future, a pass for Google Closure Compiler that understands JSX could be used, but for now, we want to focus our resources on development and in-field testing of <span class=\"tm2\">@a-la/jsx</span>.\n\n<pre><code class=\"js hljs\"><span class=\"hljs-comment\">// index.jsx</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">import</span> { Form } <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">'@depack/form'</span> <span class=\"hljs-comment\">// resolves to jsx</span>\n\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">// @depack/form/src/index.jsx</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">export</span> { Input } <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">'./Input'</span> <span class=\"hljs-comment\">// Input needs transpiling</span></code></pre>\n\nThe above example requires compiling <span class=\"tm\">node_modules/@depack/form/src/index.jsx</span> and <span class=\"tm\">node_modules/@depack/form/src/Input.jsx</span> and placing them in the temp folder, and rewiring <strong>index.js</strong> to rename <span class=\"tm\">@depack/form</span> to <span class=\"tm\">./temp/node_modules/@depack/form</span>. The solution that I tried was to detect dependencies in all node_modules\n and transpile them, so that <span class=\"tm\">Input.jsx</span> becomes <span class=\"tm\">temp/Input.js</span> and feeding the files to the compiler. However, technically that was too cumbersome to implement and would involve repeating the transpilation job for every compilation, so the problem was approached from another end, that is to transpile packages in their own directories into modules to remove JSX syntax. <em>Depack</em> can then just read already compiled packages. That would allow packages to also be used by other bundlers, and simplified the whole process.\n\n<p>\nQuite a bit of time was spent on trying to transpile node_modules\nfrom <em>Depack</em> until this strategy was abandoned. A new package <span class=\"tm\">@depack/detect</span> was created to hold code with <span class=\"tm\">import</span> regular expressions to find out all dependencies in a file (moved from <em>Depack</em>). The alternative non-scoped name for that package was <span class=\"tm\">muy-importante</span> from Family Guy because it's hilarious however I didn't do it but maybe will in future.\n\n<img style=\"display:block; padding: 1rem;\" src=\"https://thumbs.gfycat.com/DarlingImprobableFly-max-1mb.gif\" alt=\"Muy Importante\">\n\nI also registered the <span class=\"tm2\">static-analysis</span> package on NPM which is huge success, where I will move some code for detection and building of the dependency tree from <em>Depack</em>. Each new package with a significant name is a great contribution to Open Source, and in future it could be used to perform other static analysis including extracting JSDoc documentation. The static analysis is understanding the code without running it, and it has been somewhat what I've beed doing in the last months with Regular Expressions, which I use on daily basis, i.e. I've become specialised in their usage and recruited knowledge about specifics of how to use them effectively. It would be good to write an article \"JS RegExp Hacks\" for <strong>Art Deco</strong> website which will need professional content.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI then updated <em>ÀLaMode</em> to be able to transpile JSX syntax without changing <span class=\"tm\">import</span> and <span class=\"tm\">export</span> to <span class=\"tm\">require</span>, and transpiled <span class=\"tm\">@depack/form</span> using this way. Finally, to test the new transpiled version, I updated <em>FrontEnd</em> to use correct logic for resolving <strong>package.json</strong> locations using <span class=\"tm2\">fpj</span> (<em>Find Package Json</em>), and made the code much simpler. It's become a really good and stable package that I'm proud of so that I was really happy about it when published the last version. It's also innovative and could be popular among people to create an easy web development environment without having to use Webpack Dev Server and such.\n</p>\n\n<h3>TODO</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Move code and tests from <em>Depack</em> to <span class=\"tm2\">static-analysis</span> to build dependency tree.</li>\n<li>Create an article outlining hacks on how to use regexes, e.g., using <span class=\"tm\">string.replace</span> algorithm to avoid setting <span class=\"tm\">lastIndex</span> on a RegExp, and remembering <span class=\"tm\">before</span> and <span class=\"tm\">after</span> matching groups to reconstruct the string with a substituted value.</li>\n<li>Publish <em>FrontEnd</em> as <span class=\"tm\">koa-frontend</span> and allow to plug in a custom JSX transpile function for those who want to use <em>Babel</em> instead of <em>ÀLamode</em> for that which can be less error-prone because although <span class=\"tm2\">@a-la/jsx</span> transpiles JSX, there are limitations such as that there can't be <span class=\"tm\">&gt;</span> or <span class=\"tm\">&lt;</span> symbols in expressions and if people encounter any other problems, they won't be able to fix them as easily as I can when working on my projects.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"SectionBreak\">\n  <a href=\"#top\" title=\"Back To Top\">\n    <img src=\"section-breaks/2.svg\" alt=\"Back To Top\">\n  </a>\n</p>\n\n<h2>8 Friday</h2>\n\nToday I worked more on the <em>Depack</em> infrastructure and had to figure out how to create a simple-to-write <strong>Form</strong> component for <em>Bootstrap</em>. The main puzzle was to understand how to pass properties to the children components from the parent component programmatically, e.g., we want to create a <span class=\"tm\">form-group</span> which holds a label, input, hint and validation field so that the label points to the input with <span class=\"tm\">htmlFor</span> attribute, and the input points to the hind with <span class=\"tm\">aria-describedby</span> attribute. Those attributes need to be created by the form-group automatically, so that the syntax for writing forms can be concise:\n\n<pre class=\"language-jsx\"><code class=\"language-jsx\"><span

class=\"tm\">FormGroup</span> takes care of assigning the id and help-id to the label and input fields:\n\n<pre><code class=\"html hljs\"><span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;<span class=\"hljs-name\">div</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">class</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"form-group\"</span>&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;<span

class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;/<span class=\"hljs-name\">small</span>&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;/<span class=\"hljs-name\">div</span>&gt;</span></code></pre>\n\nBecause the documentation for Preact is lacking, the <span class=\"tm\">getChildContext</span> is not present anywhere in the docs. I had to Google 100 times \"pass properties to children\" to see all available methods on the Internet, and when some were so advanced using the new <a href=\"https://github.com/valotas/preact-context\">React Context API</a> that it was barely possible to grasp what they are actually doing and if it's going to affect how my forms are rendered. The first idea was to clone children components with <span class=\"tm\">cloneElement</span> from <em>Preact</em> when rendering the <span class=\"tm\">FormGroup</span> however that would be very inefficient because the input elements would not be reused by the virtual dom diffing which is the whole point of <em>Preact</em>. Finally, I found the <a href=\"https://github.com/synacor/preact-context-provider\">generic context provider</a> that would allow to pass the properties to children in a context. I started to use it, but again I met the same problem as with the <span class=\"tm\">preact-router</span> where blank text nodes were passed as children to the <span class=\"tm\">&lt;Provider&gt;</span> which rendered only the first child. Therefore I realised that the problem is really in my JSX parser, which must do some string trimming rather than passing it to the pragma function for rendering:\n\n<pre><code class=\"js hljs\">          <span class=\"hljs-comment\">// ↓ must not pass the new line to pragma</span>\nh(<span class=\"hljs-string\">'div'</span>, {}, <span class=\"hljs-string\">`\n  `</span>,h(<span class=\"hljs-string\">'a'</span>, {}),<span class=\"hljs-string\">`\n`</span>)</code></pre>\n\n<p>The strings with new lines are there to preserve lines order because source maps for JSX transpiler are not there yet, however they can be <a href=\"https://github.com/a-la/jsx/issues/1\">replaced with just whitespace</a> in code which is not going to be rendered. Nonetheless, the <span class=\"tm\">&lt;Provider&gt;</span> component still rendered only a single child, because <em>Preact</em> does not have <span class=\"tm\">&lt;&gt;</span> support. So I looked into the source code of the generic provider and found out that it uses the method called <span class=\"tm\">getChildContext</span> which is exactly what I needed. Now I was able to pass required properties to the children in a context, and <em>a)</em> pass the auto-generated <strong>id</strong> and <strong>hid</strong> properties by the <span class=\"tm\">FormGroup</span>; and <em>b)</em> pass the <strong>values</strong> property which is handled by the <span class=\"tm\">Form</span> itself, so that the root <em>Form</em> component is able to handle the logic of maintaining the values for form inputs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Figure\">\n    <img src=\"img/2019/2-feb/form.gif\" alt=\"Demo for @depack/form\" /><br />\n    \n  View the demo at <a href=\"https://dpck.github.io/form/\">https://dpck.github.io/form/</a>\n\n  </p>\n\n<p>\nThe second part of the day after initial prototype of the form, was to put it in the <span class=\"tm\">knedv.ru</span> website and see if it works. After I've done it, there were a few points that came up: first, the <span class=\"tm2\">@idio/frontend</span> did not serve packages that were linked locally, because they resolved to paths like <span class=\"tm\">../../depack/form</span> instead of <span class=\"tm\">node_modules/@depack/form</span>. This was a disadvantage, however it could be temporary overcome by importing them via relative paths (i.e. <span class=\"tm\">import { Form } from &apos;../../node_modules/@depack/form</span> instead of <span class=\"tm\">import { Form } from &apos;@depack/form&apos;</span>). The second problem was to do with how <em>Depack</em> bundled packages, where JSX syntax was not transpiled, and no additional dependencies were  discovered in required <strong>node_modules</strong>\n(only in source code).\n\n<pre><code class=\"js hljs\"><span class=\"hljs-comment\">// index.jsx</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">import</span> { Form } <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">'@depack/form'</span> <span class=\"hljs-comment\">// this is fine</span>\n\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">// @depack/form</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">export</span> { Input } <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">'./Input'</span> <span class=\"hljs-comment\">// this broke</span>\n  <span class=\"hljs-comment\">// as frontend didn't resolve paths in node_modules</span></code></pre>\n\nThis didn't come up before because I only tried to compile simple code that imported <em>Preact</em> which also had no dependencies. Therefore, in the spirit of test-driven-development, I had to write tests for the bundler logic first and then implement the change that would facilitate that. To simplify the overall structure of <em>Depack</em>, I separated the bundler logic into the <span class=\"tm\">@depack/bundle</span> package where I transferred the existing code. However, both compiler and bundler parts of <em>Depack</em> needed a method called <span class=\"tm2\">findPackageJson</span>, so to share it between them, I created a separate package called <span class=\"tm\">fpj</span> for <strong>Find Package Json</strong>. It finds the location of the <strong>package.json</strong> file for a given dependency that is required in a certain file. This will also help me in future to fix front-end bug that prevents serving linked packages, because the issue with it is that it uses <span class=\"tm\">require.resolve</span> that returns absolute paths and not linked files.\n</p>\n\n<h3>TODO</h3>\n<ul>\n\n<li>Investigate <span class=\"tm\">&lt;&gt;</span> support in JSX transpiler.</li>\n<li>Allow to evoke a component with <span class=\"tm\">&lt;this.component&gt;</span> and similar (with a dot) tags.</li>\n<li>Remove white-spaces according to React's logic in the transpiler.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"SectionBreak\">\n  <a href=\"#top\" title=\"Back To Top\">\n    <img src=\"section-breaks/3.svg\" alt=\"Back To Top\">\n  </a>\n</p>\n\n<h2>7 Thursday</h2>\n\nToday I've started to fill up the <strong>depack</strong> scope with packages on NPM by transferring existing work into it. The first two packages are <span class=\"tm\">@depack/router</span> and <span class=\"tm\">@depack/form</span> that were taken from the <span class=\"tm\">knedv.ru</span> website. The router is the adaptation of the <span class=\"tm\">preact-router</span> that was modified to work with <em>Depack</em>. The reason it wasn't working was because some properties were assigned on string nodes which threw an error, and also because <span class=\"tm2\">__preactattr_</span> was referenced without using quotes and got mangled by the Closure Compiler.\n\n<pre class=\"language-jsx\"><code class=\"language-jsx\"><span class=\"token comment\">// Original</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">import</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> render <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"token string\">'preact'</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">import</span> Router <span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"token string\">'preact-router'</span>\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> <span class=\"token function-variable function\">Component</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> title <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span>div<span class=\"token operator\">></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>title<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span><span class=\"token operator\">/</span>div<span class=\"token operator\">></span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"token function\">render</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span>Router<span class=\"token operator\">></span>\n  <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span>Component path<span class=\"token operator\">=</span><span class=\"token string\">\"/\"</span> <span class=\"token operator\">/</span><span class=\"token operator\">></span>\n<span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span><span class=\"token operator\">/</span>Router<span class=\"token operator\">></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> document<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>body<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n<pre><code class=\"js hljs\"><span class=\"hljs-comment\">// Transpiled into</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">// ...</span>\n                <span class=\"hljs-comment\">// ↓ the string that results in error</span>\nrender(h(Router,{},<span class=\"hljs-string\">`\n  `</span>,h(Component,{<span class=\"hljs-attr\">path</span>:<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"/\"</span>}),<span class=\"hljs-string\">`\n`</span>), <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">document</span>.body)</code></pre>\n\n<img src=\"img/2019/2-feb/error.jpg\" alt=\"Error in preact-router\">\n\n<p>\nI also made the demo preview of the <span class=\"tm\">@depack/router</span> using <em>Splendid</em> and had to update <em>Splendid</em> to insert files manually with the <span class=\"tm\">&lt;File&gt;</span> tag for the purpose of adding the source map to the website JavaScript bundle made with <em>Depack</em>. It will also now show an error if a page does not exist, and produce better JSX code highlighting with Prism, since highlightjs does not work with JSX.\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"Figure\">\n    <img src=\"img/2019/2-feb/appshot-Safari.gif\" alt=\"Demo for @depack/router\" /><br />\n    \n  View the demo at <a href=\"https://dpck.github.io/router/\">https://dpck.github.io/router/</a>\n\n  </p>\n\n<p>\nIn addition, I integrated the <span class=\"tm\">@idio/frontend</span> package into the <em>Idio Core</em> web server where it is possible to mount multiple frontend directories at once. There is an additional check to see if the pointed directory exists when starting the server. To sum up, the achievements of the day were moving most of the existing code into new packages, and integrating them into other tools (e.g., taking the router code out of <span class=\"tm\">knedv.ru</span> website, putting it in a separate package and then installing that package into <span class=\"tm\">knedv.ru</span> again). It is not always feasible to start making new packages straight away because when they need to be updated, the routine is more complicated when compared to the situation where the code is kept in the same package, but when the code has been somewhat manually tested, it can be made into separate software.\n</p>\n\n<p>Finally, in the spirit of starting to breath life into existing scopes and domains rather than creating new ones, I decided to use my existing <span class=\"tm\">zavr.co.uk</span> domain to blog about work to keep track of the things that I've done. I had already done so on the <a href=\"https://github.com/artdecocode/daily-log\">daily-log</a> which was a GitHub blog compiled with <em>Documentary</em>, however I thought it would be a good use-case for <em>Splendid</em> to compile a blog website, so that new features could emerge.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nUnfortunately, the <span class=\"tm\">depack</span> GitHub organisation was taken since summer which is a bummer because it's when I first thought of <em>Depack</em> and I think I could have registered the org back then. The person has only registered to open a single issue, but nevermind I got the <span class=\"tm\">dpck</span> org which is also acceptable and is cool in a way. It will specialise on publishing packages that can be safely compiled with <em>Depack</em> for front-end, since a lot of existing widgets and libraries will most likely require some adjustments to do that. The next package in the queue is <span class=\"tm\">@depack/from</span> which is a bootstrap form that was quickly written by me earlier last week. It needs a better model where the root <span class=\"tm\">Form</span> component would hold the values of all fields to be able to handle which components need re-rendering better. There are also tests to be written for front-end which is a new important chapter in <strong>Art Deco</strong> software development: <em>Zoroaster</em> will need to be modified to have a persistent context (to keep the browser open between tests), and strategies for communicating with browsers to run test suites will also need to be derived, since we're not going to use <em>Karma</em> and its adapters.\n</p>\n\n<h3>ToDo</h3>\n<ul>\n <li>Setup the front-end testing infrastructure by allowing <em>Zoroaster</em> tests to have persistent context.</li>\n <li>Update the structure in <em>Splendid</em> to have components directory with the new AjaxMenu, don't override package.json if it exists, rework example pages.</li>\n <li>Come up with a web-interface where dependencies can be updated quickly, e.g., if I update <span class=\"tm\">@a-la/jsx</span>, then <span class=\"tm\">@idio/frontend</span> needs to be updated so that <span class=\"tm\">@idio/core</span> can access the new feature or bugfix in the JSX. This is a requirement for <em>Moderne</em>, however can be implemented in MNPJS.org as well.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"SectionBreak\">\n  <a href=\"#top\" title=\"Back To Top\">\n    <img src=\"section-breaks/4.svg\" alt=\"Back To Top\">\n  </a>\n</p>","file":"4-10-february"}
