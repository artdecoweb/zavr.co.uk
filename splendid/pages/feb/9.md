## 9 Saturday

Today I picked up on the stuff from yesterday where the bugs in _Frontend_ and _Depack_ were identified. The main question that required thinking was how to compile `node_modules` in _Depack_ that export JSX components. The strategy I though I would adopt was to not even build packages and publish their source code directly like its 2019, so that _Frontend_ can serve them for development, and _Depack_ can use them in compilation. However, the compilation step would require transpiling JSX syntax and putting new files in the temp directory, but also then overriding the import statements that import such packages to point them to the transpiled version of the code. The things become even more complicated when 3rd party packages also import JSX-based files. In future, a pass for Google Closure Compiler that understands JSX could be used, but for now, we want to focus our resources on development and in-field testing of ``@a-la/jsx``.

```js
// index.jsx
import { Form } from '@depack/form' // resolves to jsx

// @depack/form/src/index.jsx
export { Input } from './Input' // Input needs transpiling
```

The above example requires compiling `node_modules/@depack/form/src/index.jsx` and `node_modules/@depack/form/src/Input.jsx` and placing them in the temp folder, and rewiring *index.js* to rename `@depack/form` to `./temp/node_modules/@depack/form`. The solution that I tried was to detect dependencies in all node_modules
 and transpile them, so that `Input.jsx` becomes `temp/Input.js` and feeding the files to the compiler. However, technically that was too cumbersome to implement and would involve repeating the transpilation job for every compilation, so the problem was approached from another end, that is to transpile packages in their own directories into modules to remove JSX syntax. _Depack_ can then just read already compiled packages. That would allow packages to also be used by other bundlers, and simplified the whole process.

<p>
Quite a bit of time was spent on trying to transpile node_modules
from _Depack_ until this strategy was abandoned. A new package `@depack/detect` was created to hold code with `import` regular expressions to find out all dependencies in a file (moved from _Depack_). The alternative non-scoped name for that package was `muy-importante` from Family Guy because it's hilarious however I didn't do it but maybe will in future.

I also registered the ``static-analysis`` package on NPM which is huge success, where I will move some code for detection and building of the dependency tree from _Depack_. Each new package with a significant name is a great contribution to Open Source, and in future it could be used to perform other static analysis including extracting JSDoc documentation. The static analysis is understanding the code without running it, and it has been somewhat what I've beed doing in the last months with Regular Expressions, which I use on daily basis, i.e. I've become specialised in their usage and recruited knowledge about specifics of how to use them effectively. It would be good to write an article "JS RegExp Hacks" for *Art Deco* website which will need professional content.
</p>

<p>
I then updated _ÀLaMode_ to be able to transpile JSX syntax without changing `import` and `export` to `require`, and transpiled `@depack/form` using this way. Finally, to test the new transpiled version, I updated _FrontEnd_ to use correct logic for resolving *package.json* locations using ``fpj`` (_Find Package Json_), and made the code much simpler. It's become a really good and stable package that I'm proud of so that I was really happy about it when published the last version. It's also innovative and could be popular among people to create an easy web development environment without having to use Webpack Dev Server and such.

### TODO

<ul>
* Move code and tests from _Depack_ to ``static-analysis`` to build dependency tree.
* Create an article outlining hacks on how to use regexes, e.g., using `string.replace` algorithm to avoid setting `lastIndex` on a RegExp, and remembering `before` and `after` matching groups to reconstruct the string with a substituted value.
* Publish _FrontEnd_ as `koa-frontend` and allow to plug in a custom JSX transpile function for those who want to use _Babel_ instead of _ÀLamode_ for that which can be less error-prone because although ``@a-la/jsx`` transpiles JSX, there are limitations such as that there can't be `>` or `<` symbols in expressions and if people encounter any other problems, they won't be able to fix them as easily as I can when working on my projects.
