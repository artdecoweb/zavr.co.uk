## 11 Monday

<p>

On Monday, I worked on filling in the `static-analysis` package with the code from _Depack_, so that when I took it out of _Depack_, the latter looked much neater because it focused on packing the code together rather than performing the static analysis tasks. I also documented the new package so that I can visually see what it generates by automatically embedding examples. This new package was also needed for the *bundle* part of _Depack_ to discover dependencies in node_modules
. The task was complete successfully and I was able to integrate ``@depack/bundle`` into _Depack_ and compile the `knedv.ru` Preact website. Additionally, I released the change to _Ã€LaMode_ that was required to build JSX modules to prepare them for _Depack_ bundling, since it was decided that external modules would have to provide already compiled JSX code to simplify the process.
</p>

I then worked more on documentation of the _Form_ package for _Depack_ and included the types notations as well as examples. I found the way to provide _JSDoc_ IntelliSense suggestions for the VSCode for components written as classes, which I struggled with before. It's a workaround that requires an extra meaningless line to the code, but it is worth the result that it produces. For example, to document the ``FormGroup`` component, I would have to add the `this.props = this.props` assignment annotated with the type:

</p>

```js
/**
 * The div with `form-group` class to hold the label, input, help and validation message.
 */
export class FormGroup extends Component {
  constructor() {
    super()
    this.id = `i${Math.floor(Math.random() * 100000)}`
    this.hid = `h${this.id}`
    /**
     * @type {FormGroupProps}
     */
    this.props = this.props
  }
  /* ... methods */
}
```

<p>
The props can then also be used in the documentation by simply calling `%TYPEDEF types/index.xml FormGroupProps%` which _Documentary_ understands. This help to discover the bug which I then fixed in _Documentary_ when types tables referenced by name after the first one were not inserted.

Towards the end of the day, I spent some time on writing an HTML formatter, because after I removed passing new lines as strings to the JSX pragma (see previous week), the `preact-render-to-string` package started to render the code without indentations which was hard to read and not suitable for the documentation. Therefore, I made a simple at-first function that split tags at `><` point and inserted new lines between them. It was then modified to account for opening and closing tags, as well as if the tag is a textarea element which means there cannot be any new lines. I then had a neat function which also indented attributes after the line width became too large, and presented all example HTML output of the _Form_ component in a nice way:
</p>

```html
<form>
  <div class="form-group">
    <label htmlFor="i90435">
      Input
    </label>
    <input name="input" class="form-control" value="hello-world" type="text"
      aria-describedby="hi90435" id="i90435" />
    <small id="hi90435" class="form-text text-muted">
      Type in something...
    </small>
  </div>
  <div class="form-group">
    <label htmlFor="i12194">
      Select
    </label>
    <select name="select" value="2" class="custom-select" id="i12194"
      aria-describedby="hi12194">
      <option>

      </option>
      <option value="1">
        Free will
      </option>
      <option value="2" selected="true">
        Unfree will
      </option>
    </select>
    <small id="hi12194" class="form-text text-muted">
      Please select...
    </small>
  </div>
  <div class="form-group">
    <label htmlFor="i51376">
      TextArea
    </label>
    <textarea name="textarea" aria-describedby="hi51376" class="form-control" id="i51376" rows="3">One must still have chaos in oneself to be able to give birth to a dancing star.</textarea>
    <small id="hi51376" class="form-text text-muted">
      Multiple row input...
    </small>
  </div>
</form>
```

### TODO
<ul>
* Make the html formatter a separate package.
* Unit test rendering of components with `preact-render-to-string` first before writing acceptance tests for the browser. `rexml` package can be used here, however it would not be able to extract multiple elements of the same kind in a parent.
* Add an article on Medium about how to add JSDoc for Preact class components without using TypeScript.
</ul>
