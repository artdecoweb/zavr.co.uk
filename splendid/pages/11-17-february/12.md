## 12 Tuesday

<p>Today I worked on documentation of the _Depack/Form_ package, and improved the formatting of HTML. The examples now also use the seeded random number generator that prevented updating of `id` values each time the documentation generator is run. I finished documenting every component and described writing custom components.
<br>
At night, during working on the website to close [#1](https://github.com/dpck/form/issues/1), I encountered the problem with the website generation where the demo would not re-render after AJAX navigation, because scripts dynamically added to the page via setting `innerHTML` on the container component do not execute. I went on to research the possible solutions and found the thread on _StackOverflow_ describing how to solve the problem, by extracting the scripts using the regular expressions. [The change](https://github.com/artdecocode/splendid/blob/master/src/js/ajax-loader/index.js#L96) had to be made to _Splendid_ so that received scripts are executed. The adaptation to the original script was made to enable executing scripts with `module` type. The source maps for the _AJAX_ library was also added to enable debugging, as well as source maps for the bundle Depack/Form compiled with _Depack_.</p>

```js
function stripAndExecuteScript(text) {
  var scripts = ''
  var modules = []
  var cleaned = text.replace(/<script([^>]*)>([\s\S]*?)<\/script>/gi, function(m, tags, script){
    if (/type="module"/.test(tags)) {
      modules.push(script)
      return
    }
    scripts += script + '\n'
    return ''
  })

  modules.forEach(function(mod) {
    makeScript(mod, true)
  })

  makeScript(scripts)
}
```

<p>
On the about page, the _Depack/Form_ demo is loaded from the compiled bundle made with _Depack_, whereas The `Modules Demo` page on the website loads the source code via modules. It was made to show the possibility of executing the javascript source code via the native browser functionality in modern browsers. It helped to discover a use case of when one would need to collect all dependencies' source files into a single directory which can be served by a CDN for example.

## ToDo

<ToDo>Make it possible to generate modules to put on the static HTML server such as GitHub pages with Depack without bundling them into a single file. This includes supplying imports like `preact` with the source code in a separate file, as well is updating relative paths. This is partly what generating the temp directory does already.</ToDo>
<ToDo>Teach _Splendid_ to extract `<Scripts>` components to make it work better with Ajax by updating the `ajax` version of generated pages to have the `scripts` field in addition to the page's in-container `source` and `title`.</ToDo>
