## 11-17 February

The job for this week is to finish work on _Depack_, document the frontend bundler part of it, and add the possibility to override Node.js builtin externs. The message about it can then be spread on the Google Closure Compiler group and Medium. After that, _Zoroaster_ can be modified to have persistent contexts and test frontend Preact packages that I have and will make (``router`` and ``form``). On the 15<sup>th</sup>, the call for papers for [JSCamp in Barcelona](https://jscamp.tech/) opens, so I will apply to that with the story about _Depack_ and _Frontend_, which could hopefully be useful to others.
