## 10 Sunday

Today I focused on closing 2 issues in the JSX: trimming of new lines as React does, and allowing for JSX attributes. The job was fairly easy because the tests already existed, so that it was programming for results, i.e., to have an idea and quickly adjust the program to make it possible. I spent some amount of time on updating the `rexml` package to be able to extract XML attributes, and then integrated it in _JSX_, however I realised I could do the parsing without it by a generic algorithm, so although I released the change to `rexml`, it was not used in the end. Finally, I was happy to close the 2 issues created on GitHub, and I have to complete the other two within a week so that the package receives the positive ranking by NPM search which takes into account how many issues were closes within a certain period of time. Finally, I made the quick change to _Splendid_ to be able to reverse the order of how files in a directory are put together, to facilitate the blog structure.

  Overall, I had a good week with getting back to blogging about work and tracking the process. Although I spent a bit of time on writing about what I've done in the previous day, it helps me to remember things I came across and note down the future *todo* points. The main job was to allow to bundle frontend packages with _Depack_ and I discovered that it was more complicated than I though before because previously I didn't account for the fact that node_modules
  packages could import other packages as well. I transferred the existing code into smaller packages, documented and tested them which is the correct strategy for utilising scopes and organisations.
