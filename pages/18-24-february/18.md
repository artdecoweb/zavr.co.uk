## 18 Monday

Today I've spent some time on testing the new _Splendid_ components that were translated from RegExp rules with _Zoroaster_. This required an update to the latter as well to pass the mask properties not only to fork configurators (as last week), but to all constructors, including `getResults`, `getTransform` and others. This was needed to set the `page` properties on the test to enable rendering of the `<PageTitle>` component that accessed `splendid.page` property, so that when set within the mask result and not the mask itself, tests become much more flexible since the input properties can be controlled from each test case rather than the mask constructor.

```js
// Mask Definition
export default makeTestSuite('test/result/components/index.html', {
  getTransform() {
    const { page } = this
    const comps = getRules(Components)
    const rs = new Replaceable(comps)
    rs.splendid = { config: { pretty: true }, page },
    rs.cache = {}
    return rs
  },
  jsonProps: ['page'],
})
```

```jsx
// Mask Result: adds page title
<PageTitle />

/* page */
{ "title": "Page" }
/**/

/* expected */
<title>Page</title>
/**/
```

I've also tested the `<File>` component with _TempContext_ which wrote the specified file into the `test/temp` directory and read it at the end of the test to make sure that the file is correctly copied. Meanwhile, I worked on the ``zavr.co.uk`` website to catch up with the writing for the previous week. I've been sloppy on blogging last week however it's become really important to see what I've done rather than to just allow work to silently accumulated. It also helps to accumulate new use-cases and features for _Splendid_.
