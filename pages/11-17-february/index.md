## 11-17 February

The job for this week is to finish work on _Depack_, document the frontend bundler part of it, and add the possibility to override Node.js builtin externs. The message about it can then be spread on the Google Closure Compiler group and Medium. After that, _Zoroaster_ can be modified to have persistent contexts and test frontend Preact packages that I have and will make (``router`` and ``form``). On the 15<sup>th</sup>, the call for papers for [JSCamp in Barcelona](https://jscamp.tech/) opens, so I will apply to that with the story about _Depack_ and _Frontend_, which could hopefully be useful to others.

## Week Results

<p>This week was slower than the previous one and more relaxed with more freestyle creative work rather than concrete focus.</p>

<p>The things accomplished were:</P>

<ul>
* Create the website for _Depack/Form_;
* Update _Splendid_ to allow for mounted websites and switching to using JSX components;
* Documenting _Depack/Form_ with pretty html;
* Finding the way to enable JSDoc properties autocompletion for Class components;
* Improving _Zoroaster_ to pass mask properties to mask constructors;
* Releasing <NPMBadge package="logarithm" version="1.0.0">_Logarithm_</NPMBadge> built with _Depack_;
* Creating the _Depack/Render_ and improving Preact's algorithm for pretty print;
* Fixing the bugs in _Ã€La/JSX_ related to boolean attributes;
* Adding _Depack/Context_ for mask-testing of front-end JSX components;
* Registering the `@reducer` NPM scope (with ``rdcr`` GitHub org) and creating the `render-reducer` package which in future will make sure that the element is always rendered whenever its parent is present.
</ul>
