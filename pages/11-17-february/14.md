## 14 Thursday

First thing on Thursday was refactoring some components in _Splendid_ into being JSX components, including the ``<SectionBreak/>``, ``<File/>`` and ``<PageTitle/>``. The new architecture to use JSX is better than simple regular expressions, because it's more idiosyncratic and could eventually help to write components for dynamic front-end as well, such as embedding them with _Preact_. It's also easier to maintain and document, however there is still an issue that the autosuggestions for component properties do not appear in the pages source code, however this could only be overcome by making all pages JSX components which is opposite to the goal of _Splendid_ that allows to write simple HTML and markdown but embed components. Nonetheless, the new components looks much better, compare:

```js
// The old way
import rexml from 'rexml'
const breaksRule = {
  re: /( *)(<SectionBreak.*?\/>)/gm,
  replacement(m, ws, SectionBreak) {
    const [{
      props: { width, id: i = this.breaksCount, alt = 'Back To Top', href = '#top' }
    }] = rexml('SectionBreak', SectionBreak)
    const id = parseInt(i || '0')
    const w = width ? ` width="${width}"` : ''
    const res = `<p class="SectionBreak">
  <a href="${href}" title="${alt}">
    <img src="splendid://section-breaks/${id}.svg" alt="${alt}"${w}>
  </a>
</p>`
    this.breaksCount = id + 1
    return res.replace(/^/gm, ws)
  },
}

export default breaksRule
```

```jsx
// The new way
export default async function SectionBreak({
  width, alt = 'Back To Top', href = '#top',
  splendid, id: i = splendid.breaksCount,
}) {
  const id = parseInt(i || '0')
  splendid.breaksCount = id + 1
  return (<p className="SectionBreak">
    <a href={href} title={alt}>
      <img src={`splendid://section-breaks/${id}.svg`}
        alt={alt} width={width} />
    </a>
  </p>)
}
```

<p>JSX Components are also nicer to test and will help me to derive the infrastructure for testing frontend software. I choose the testing strategy that would involve rendering the components using `preact-render-to-string` as the initial unit tests. However, I was not happy with the fact that this package is dependent on the *pretty-format* package which belongs to Facebook and also pulls the `strip-ansi` package downloads counter of which I don't want to increase (I don't like popular packages). Therefore, I forked it and made a new package for rendering server-side HTML called _Depack/Render_. The main advantage of doing that is that I understood more how server-side rendering is done in _Preact_, and made some modifications myself. In particular, I improved the *pretty printing* functionality which in original _Preact/Render_ would put each new attribute on the new line which is not feasible for documentation. Earlier this week, I wrote a simple script to format HTML, however it was error-prone and approached the problem from outside of the black "rendering" box, whereas modifying the actual rendering logic is getting inside of that box and having more control of what's happening. This made the previous script for formatting HTML redundant, however I was then able to compile _Depack/Form_ documentation with _Depack/Render_ and it was nicely presented like I wanted it to.</p>

<p>There were some bugs I found out about in the <NPMBadge package="@a-la/jsx" version="1.4.0">_Ã€-La/JSX_</NPMBadge> such as that boolean attributes were assigned the value of *1* rather than an empty value, which _Preact_ rendering was expecting, e.g., the `<input required>` would be incorrectly rendered as `<input required="1">`. And exactly because I forked _Preact/Render_ and studied the source code while modifying it for my _Depack/Render_ fork I was able to identify this problem. The second bug was discovered when writing unit-tests and involved JSX package only processing a single boolean attribute where there could be any number of them. The problem was solved with a single `g` modifier to the RegExp.</p>

### ToDo

<ToDo>When counting the line length in _Depack/Render_, the whitespace before the line should also be considered.</ToDo>
<ToDo>Load CSS from components' source code into the page source.</ToDo>
<ToDo>Write documentation for _Splendid_ components.</ToDo>

<SectionBreak />
