## 17 Sunday

<p>On Sunday, I wanted to document using _Depack/Render_ on a server for server-side-rendering, like the original [_Preact_ documentation](https://github.com/developit/preact-render-to-string/#render-jsx--preact--whatever-via-express) does for Express. I also added the `doctype` option that would automatically add ``<!doctype html>`` at the beginning of the rendered string, and fixed a JSDoc bug due to incorrect typedef name in the config, that prevented developers from seeing the correct property expansion on the `Config` property, which was at some point renamed to be `RenderConfig`. The types directory also had to be published because the types were to be used in another package called _Depack/Context_ used for testing of front-end components.</p>

<p>_Depack/Context_'s job is to take the JSX source code from the mask, transform it into HTML and compare the expected output of the mask. The two packages used for that are _Ã€La/JSX_ to compile the source into *h* pragma invocations by Preact, and _Depack/Render_ to render the invocations into actual HTML. The _Depack/Render_ is also tested with the JSX context, but using the source `render` function rather the one provided by the context. The context and render packages had to be linked because they depend on each other, however after _Depack/Render_ is released and used in _Depack/Context_, it does not need releasing even after the context version is increased since it's only a dev dependency, otherwise there would be an infinite race to increase versions of these two packages. Finally, I also tested the _Depack/Form_ component with the context, which will now be the standard way to mask test components. The context is similar to the snapshot testing, however with the advantage of not having to write a test logic for each input.
</p>

```jsx
// returns the correct output
<Form></Form>

/* expected */
<form></form>
/**/

// creates FormGroup
<FormGroup label="test" help="ok">
  <Input placeholder="test"/>
</FormGroup>

/* expected */
<div class="form-group">
  <label htmlFor="i70984">test</label>
  <input placeholder="test"
    class="form-control" type="text"
    aria-describedby="hi70984" id="i70984" />
  <small id="hi70984"
    class="form-text text-muted">ok
  </small>
</div>
/**/
```

Lastly, one interesting feature is passing the references to the components used in masks' JSX input, which enables testing of the built components with the `test-build` command.

```js
import Form, { FormGroup, Input } from '../../src'
// during the `test-build`:            '../../build'

export default makeTestSuite('test/result/index.jsx', {
  /**
   * @param {string} input
   * @param {JSXContext} context
   */
  getResults(input, { getVNode, render }) {
    const vnode = getVNode(input, {
      Form, FormGroup, Input, // PASS THE SOURCE COMPONENTS
    })
    const res = render(vnode, {
      pretty: true,
    })
    return res
  },
}
```

The good thing about test contexts, as always, is that they provide accessible *JSDoc* documentation for the testing API that they provide.
