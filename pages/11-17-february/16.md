## 16 Saturday

Saturday involved finishing off updating the _ContextTesting/Fork_ logic to perform the mask testing where mask's properties would be passed to the fork config generator functions such as `getArgs` and `getOptions`. In addition, I added the appropriate documentation to the `fork` package with the example of how to use it. I then published it, integrated into _Zoroaster_ so that the tests I wrote the previous day started to pass and used the newer version to test _Ã€LaMode_ which confirmed the fork context logic to work correctly.
