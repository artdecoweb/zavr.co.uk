## 13 Wednesday

<p>On Wednesday, I started by adding two badges to the website, the `NPMBadge` and `GitHub` badge, which were implemented as components. There was also a `SelfBadge` which would read information from the `package.json` of the package for which the website is made with _Splendid_ and display the correct information there. The components are also made to be *async* now so that they can execute some asynchronous operation before their rendering. This type of JSX components is only made for _Splendid_ and cannot be used in other JSX components.</p>

<p>I then worked more on _Splendid_ to enable correct AJAX behaviour when a page is mounted not on the root of the domain, e.g., [https://dpck.github.io/form/](https://dpck.github.io/form/). It required an update the the frontend *ajax-loader.js* script, which would receive the `root` property from the _Splendid_ config, and load the page from there. Otherwise, webpages were attempted to always load from the root which GitHub pages does not allow. An update to the _Splendid_ core was also required to tell the development server to serve files from the specified mount point. Another learning outcome is to compile AJAX library as the IIFE in isolation mode to prevent the overriding of scoped functions by other scripts. For example, the compiled AJAX code has the function named `x`, and the demo source code had the same function since they're both compiled with Google Closure Compiler, but because the latter was added at a later point, it would override the original `x` function and prevent AJAX navigation from working.</p>

<p>Finally, I've finished documenting the `logarithm` software and published it on the NPM. The middleware allows to log each request's information into ElasticSearch. It was also compiled with _Depack_ to ensure to install only dependencies for the API version of the package. I then enabled _Logarithm_ on the ``knedv.ru`` website, and I could see the visitors to the developments server (i.e., me) in the Kibana dashboard.</p>

<ToDo>Make an interactive component for `NPMBadge` that would show package information on hover (or do it with CSS).</ToDo>
<ToDo>Update _Logarithm_ to understand encoded characters.</ToDo>
